    PredefinedDynamicalSystems

Module which contains pre-defined dynamical systems used in DynamicalSystems.jl
Predefined systems exist as functions that
return a `DynamicalSystem` instance. They are accessed like:
```julia
ds = PredefinedDynamicalSystems.lorenz(u0; œÅ = 32.0)
```
The alias `Systems` is also exported as a deprecation.

This module is provided purely as a convenience.
Nothing here is tested, nor guaranteed to be stable in future versions.
It is not recommended to use this module for anything else besides
on-the-spot demonstrative examples.

For some systems, a Jacobian function is also defined.
The naming convention for the jacobian function is `\$(name)_jacob`.
So, for the above example we have `J = Systems.lorenz_jacob`.
